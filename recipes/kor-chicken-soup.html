            <h2> Description</h2>
            Ginseng warms your body from inside out as well as chicken. Usually summer time(when the weather is hot) our outer body is hot so our inner body is very busy to cool the body down. So drink or eating cold food makes our tummy even more colder. That is why people get sick easily with the food during the summer time. Some smart Koreans figured it out and recommended to eat warm and hot food during summer time.
            So traditionally we eat Samgyetang 3 times during the summer. The beginning, the middle and the end.
            Protein wasn’t always available for everybody back then in Korea, even 50, 60 years ago. So Samgyetang helped provide strength through out challenging hot weather. It is consider as a stamina food.
